# DEMENTIA-TREATMENT

This repository contains the implementation of machine learning models for dementia diagnosis and personalized treatment planning. The study aims to explore the potential of machine learning in improving diagnostic accuracy and developing tailored treatment strategies for dementia patients.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on [Mendeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/tsy6rbc5d4/1). It includes key features such as the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and MRI-derived metrics, which are essential for model training and evaluation.

## Models Used
- Gradient Boosting
- Random Forest

## Key Features
- **Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR):** Used to assess the severity of dementia.
- **Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE):** Provides a cognitive assessment score.
- **MRI Metrics:** Extracted features from MRI scans to aid diagnosis.

## Results
Gradient Boosting demonstrated higher accuracy and was more effective in handling imbalanced datasets, making it the preferred choice for this study.
